	<h3 style="font-family:arial;font-size:100%";>THIS IS ALL SAMPLE TEXT AND WILL CHANGE. I'm Kelley Vaughn-Kauffman, a web developer/designer based in NYC. I have ten years of experience in the graphic design and print-production world in New York. I am coming off of a 5 year "break" from work in which to raise my two young sons. This experience has given me an incredible skill-set of problem-solving, relationship-managing, budgeting, time-management...the list goes on. Design-wise, I have specialized in works for the music industry. Production-wise, the bulk of my experience has been corporate. Naturally in work and in life, I live for finding paths rarely taken, yet relish the times when everything is familiar. The right balance.</h3>
